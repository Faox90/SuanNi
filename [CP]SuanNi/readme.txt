Suanni is basically finished now. Because I don't know how to code, I rely on tutorials, mods and friends to make it, so there may be some bugs or errors. If you encounter any, please contact me or comment.
Suanni has been adapted for all festivals. I haven't had time to test the summit and Jiangdao vacation. If there are any errors, please contact me.
This is the first time I made this kind of MOD. Time is very tight, so please forgive me if there are any shortcomings.
Special thanks to Elvis for his help, which really helped me a lot. Some modules also come from the MOD released by Jiu Sui Da Lao, and I am also very grateful.
